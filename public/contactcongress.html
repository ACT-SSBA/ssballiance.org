      <p>Most Senators and Representatives have a contact form that you can use to email them.

      <br>
      <p>Your time is well-spent doing this. Congressional staff are required to keep records of which bills constituents (i.e. people who live in their district or state) contact their office about. Staff report these tallies to their Representative/Senator and other staff.</p>

      <strong>For example, let's say you're a small software business owner...</strong>
      <br>

      <p>Dear Representative (Name),</p>
      <br>
      <p> I am a small business owner located in (City, State). I am writing to you today to encourage you to support HR 2673, which allows for the immediate expensing of R&E expenses under Section 174 of the tax code. As a small software business, we are hit particularly hard by this change in the tax code, and as a result, we have frozen hiring. Please see below for a letter sent to Congress on April 18, 2023 from 597 small software business owners which provides more details on the impact of the issue.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thank you</p>

      <strong>Or let's say you work for a software company (of any size) and are concerned it will lead to industry-wide layoffs...</strong>
      <br>
      <p>Dear Senator (Name),</p>
      <br>
      <p> I am a software developer located in (City, State). I am writing to you today to encourage you to support S. 866, which allows for the immediate expensing of R&E expenses under Section 174 of the tax code. As someone who works for a software business, I am concerned that this tax change will result in layoffs and higher unemployment in the software industry if R&E expensing is not reinstated and made retroactive to 2022. Please see below for a letter sent to Congress on April 18, 2023 from 597 small software business owners which provides more details on the impact of the issue and how many software businesses are now freezing hiring, laying off staff, or otherwise encountering financial difficulties because of this sudden tax increase.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thank you</p>
